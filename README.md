A small Android application to circumvent the default Amazon Fire launcher.
Thanks to ParrotGeek1 for the original code and the lax licence that I have modified lightly.<br/>

# Important
<ul>
<li>This application will only work for Amazon devices running the fire launcher.</li>
<li>You must enable the Accessibility Service through "Settings -> Accessibility -> To detect home button press" or nothing is going to happen.</li>
</ul>

# License
You can do whatever you want with this code but you have to credit us, Andy A (BaronKiko) and ParrotGeek, somewhere in your project, including a link to this repo. The modified version MUST be open source. You have to send us a link to the modified version if it is ever public.

# Bugs
If you find any issues please leave them in the issue tracker. I will have a look at them but don't expect bug fixes to be quick if ever fixed.
