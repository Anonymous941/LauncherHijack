# LauncherHijackV2
for Amazon devices

Thanks to ParrotGeek1 for the original code and the lax licence that I have modified lightly.

# License
You can do whatever you want with this code but you have to credit us, Andy A (BaronKiko) and ParrotGeek, somewhere in your project, including a link to this repo. The modified version MUST be open source. You have to send us a link to the modified version if it is ever public.

# Bugs
If you find any issues please leave them in the issue tracker. I will have a look at them but don't expect bug fixes to be quick if ever fixed.
