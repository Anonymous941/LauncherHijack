# Important
<ul>
<li>This application will only work for Amazon devices running the fire launcher.</li>
<li>You must enable the Accessibility Service through "Settings -> Accessibility -> To detect home button press" or nothing is going to happen.</li>
<li>There are further trouble shooting steps on the official XDA thread</li>
</ul>
